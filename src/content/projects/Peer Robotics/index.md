## Context

In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, Peer Robotics stands at the forefront of developing collaborative robots for manufacturing and warehousing environments. As the company's technology advanced, the need for a digital presence that could effectively communicate their innovative solutions to a global audience became apparent.[^1]

> Peer Robotics is revolutionizing the way humans and robots work together, creating more efficient and safer work environments.

The website redesign project aimed to create a digital platform that not only showcased Peer Robotics' cutting-edge technology but also educated potential clients about the benefits and applications of collaborative robots in various industries.

## Challenge

The existing website failed to capture the innovative spirit of Peer Robotics and presented several challenges in terms of user experience and engagement. Our task was to address these issues while creating a website that could grow with the company.

### Status Quo

The previous website had several critical issues:

- **Outdated Design**: The visual design did not reflect Peer Robotics' cutting-edge technology and innovation.
- **Poor Information Architecture**: Users struggled to find relevant information about products and use cases.
- **Lack of Engagement**: The site failed to effectively demonstrate the robots in action, missing opportunities to engage visitors.
- **Mobile Unfriendly**: The site was not optimized for mobile devices, alienating a significant portion of potential users.

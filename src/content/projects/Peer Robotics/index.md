## Context

In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, Peer Robotics stands at the forefront of developing collaborative robots for manufacturing and warehousing environments. As the company's technology advanced, there was a growing need for a digital presence that could effectively communicate their innovative solutions to a global audience.

> Peer Robotics is revolutionizing the way humans and robots work together, creating more efficient and safer work environments.

The website redesign project aimed to create a digital platform that not only showcased Peer Robotics' cutting-edge technology but also educated potential clients about the benefits and applications of collaborative robots in various industries.

## Challenge

The existing website failed to capture the innovative spirit of Peer Robotics and presented several challenges in terms of user experience and engagement. Our task was to address these issues while creating a platform that could grow with the company.

### Status Quo

The previous website had several critical issues:

- **Outdated Design**: The visual design was not reflective of Peer Robotics' cutting-edge technology and innovation.
- **Poor Information Architecture**: Users struggled to find relevant information about products and use cases.
- **Lack of Engagement**: The site failed to effectively demonstrate the robots in action, missing opportunities to engage visitors.
- **Mobile Unfriendly**: The site was not optimized for mobile devices, alienating a significant portion of potential users.

## Specific Design Decisions

1. **Dynamic Hero Section**
   - Decision: Implement a video background showcasing robots in action
   - Rationale: Immediately demonstrate the capabilities of Peer Robotics' products
   - Implementation: Created a looping video montage with key stats overlaid

2. **Industry-Specific Landing Pages**
   - Decision: Develop tailored landing pages for key industries (e.g., automotive, e-commerce)
   - Rationale: Provide targeted information to different user segments
   - Implementation: Created template-based pages with industry-specific content and use cases

3. **Interactive Knowledge Base**
   - Decision: Implement a searchable, categorized knowledge base
   - Rationale: Improve self-service capabilities for users seeking technical information
   - Implementation: Developed a tag-based system with advanced search functionality

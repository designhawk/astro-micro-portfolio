## Challenge

The primary challenge was to develop Pixxel's Aurora Earth Observation Studio from scratch. Our goal was to create a platform that allows users to access, visualize, and analyze satellite data intuitively. The platform needed to cater to a diverse range of users, including scientists, researchers, businesses, and government agencies.[^1]

## Status Quo

Before Aurora, users had limited options for accessing and analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery. Existing platforms were often difficult to navigate and lacked intuitive visualization tools, making it challenging for users to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Process

### 1. Research and Analysis

#### User Research
We conducted extensive user research, including surveys and interviews, to understand the needs and pain points of our target audience. Key insights included:

- Users required a platform that was easy to navigate.
- There was a strong demand for intuitive visualization tools.
- Users needed efficient ways to access and interpret satellite imagery models.

#### Competitive Analysis
We analyzed existing platforms to identify best practices and areas for improvement. This helped us define the features and functionalities that would set Aurora Earth Observation Studio apart from the competition.

### 2. Wireframing and Prototyping

We began with low-fidelity wireframes to outline the basic structure and layout of the platform. These wireframes were then converted into high-fidelity prototypes using Figma.

### 3. Visual Design

The visual design focused on creating a clean and modern interface. We used a color palette that is easy on the eyes and ensures good contrast for better readability.

### 4. User Testing

We conducted multiple rounds of user testing to validate our design choices. Feedback from these sessions was used to make iterative improvements.[^2]

## Final Result Showcase

### Quick Visualization Indices

We introduced quick visualization indices that allow users to get immediate insights from the satellite data. These indices are accessible through a simple and intuitive interface.

### Satellite Imagery Models

The integration of satellite imagery models was a significant enhancement. Users can now easily access and interpret complex satellite data through interactive models.

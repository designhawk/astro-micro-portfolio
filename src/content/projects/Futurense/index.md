## Challenge

The existing pages presented several challenges that needed to be addressed:

### Status Quo

## Development Collaboration and Performance Optimization

Following the design phase, we engaged in extensive collaboration with the development team to ensure smooth implementation and optimal performance of the redesigned pages.

### Collaboration with Development Team

- **Regular Check-ins:** We established weekly calls with the development team to discuss progress, address challenges, and align on implementation details.

- **Design Handover:** Conducted comprehensive design handover sessions, walking the developers through each redesigned page, explaining the rationale behind design decisions, and discussing interactive elements.
- **Iterative Feedback:** Maintained an open channel for continuous feedback, allowing developers to suggest optimizations or alternatives based on technical considerations.

### Performance Optimization

To ensure the redesigned pages not only looked great but also performed well, we worked closely with the development team to implement various optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading:** Implemented lazy loading for images and other heavy content using the Intersection Observer API, improving initial page load speed.

2. **CDN Integration:** Leveraged a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets, reducing server load and improving global access speeds.

3. **JavaScript Libraries:**
   - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Used for smooth, performant animations throughout the site, enhancing user experience without compromising speed.
   - **Plyr:** Integrated this lightweight, accessible HTML5 media player for video content, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and performance.
   - **Spide:** Employed this lightweight slider library for carousels and image galleries, offering better performance compared to heavier alternatives.

### Results of Optimization Efforts

- **Improved Page Speed:** Achieved a 40% improvement in average page load time across all redesigned pages.
- **Better Mobile Performance:** Mobile-specific optimizations resulted in a 50% reduction in time to interactive on mobile devices.

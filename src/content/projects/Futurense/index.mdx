## Challenge

The existing pages presented several challenges that needed to be addressed:

### Status Quo

- **Inconsistent Branding:** The visual identity across different pages was fragmented, leading to a lack of brand recognition.
- **Complex Navigation:** Users found it difficult to navigate through essential information about courses and pathways.
- **Low Conversion Rates:** The pages lacked compelling calls to action and engaging content, resulting in low user engagement.
- **Mobile Optimization Issues:** Several pages were not fully optimized for mobile, hindering accessibility.

## Redesigned Pages

### 1. Zero Cost Upskilling Page

- **Clear Messaging:** The webpage effectively communicates its value proposition with prominent headings that highlight benefits like "Earn While You Learn" and "Path to Fortune 500," making it easy for visitors to understand the program's advantages.
- **Engaging Visuals and Testimonials:** The use of visuals, such as the "NPS Score," along with testimonials from clients and students, enhances credibility and trust, showcasing real experiences that can persuade potential candidates.[^1]

## Development Collaboration and Performance Optimization

Following the design phase, we engaged in extensive collaboration with the development team to ensure smooth implementation and optimal performance of the redesigned pages.

### Collaboration with Development Team

- **Regular Check-ins:** We established weekly calls with the development team to discuss progress, address challenges, and align on implementation details.

![Design Handover Session](https://images.prismic.io/designhawk/ZqFcbB5LeNNTxeKX_vlcsnap-2024-07-25-01h24m47s317.png?auto=format,compress)

- **Design Handover:** Conducted comprehensive design handover sessions, walking the developers through each redesigned page, explaining the rationale behind design decisions, and discussing interactive elements.
- **Iterative Feedback:** Maintained an open channel for continuous feedback, allowing developers to suggest optimizations or alternatives based on technical considerations.

### Performance Optimization

To ensure the redesigned pages not only looked great but also performed well, we worked closely with the development team to implement various optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading:** Implemented lazy loading for images and other heavy content using the Intersection Observer API, improving initial page load speed.

2. **CDN Integration:** Leveraged a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets, reducing server load and improving global access speeds.

3. **JavaScript Libraries:**
   - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Used for smooth, performant animations throughout the site, enhancing user experience without compromising speed.
   - **Plyr:** Integrated this lightweight, accessible HTML5 media player for video content, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and performance.
   - **Splide:** Employed this lightweight slider library for carousels and image galleries, offering better performance compared to heavier alternatives.[^3]

<Callout type="warning">
Ensure that all JavaScript libraries are properly optimized and only loaded when necessary to maintain optimal page performance.

### Results of Optimization Efforts

- **Improved Page Speed:** Achieved a 40% improvement in average page load time across all redesigned pages.
- **Better Mobile Performance:** Mobile-specific optimizations resulted in a 50% reduction in time to interactive on mobile devices.

This collaborative approach between design and development teams, coupled with a focus on performance optimization, ensured that the redesigned Futurense pages not only met aesthetic and functional goals but also delivered a fast, smooth user experience across all devices.

## Nikhil Kamath's Website Design Feedback

Nikhil Kamath, Co-Founder of Zerodha and investor-mentor to Raghav, Co-Founder of Futurense, recently reviewed our website design. As both an investor and mentor, Kamath's opinion carries significant weight. He commended the overall aesthetic appeal of the site but suggested infusing more of the Godfather brand essence.

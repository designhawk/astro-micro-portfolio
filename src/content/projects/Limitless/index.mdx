## Challenge

At this stage, the first version of the website had already gone live. We were able to gather both qualitative and quantitative feedback, which helped us understand user challenges and prioritize them. It was a fast-paced exercise to develop insights within a week and present them.

### Status Quo

The previous website had several issues:

- **Outdated Design**: The visual design failed to align with modern web standards and didn't reflect the brand's innovative ethos.
- **Poor Navigation**: Users found it challenging to find relevant articles and resources.

## Challenge

As a design studio, Studio Carbon needed a website that would serve as a testament to their creative capabilities. The challenge was to create a digital experience that was both visually striking and functionally efficient.

### Status Quo

The previous website had several issues:

- **Limited Portfolio Showcase**: The existing site didn't effectively highlight the breadth and depth of Studio Carbon's work.
- **Lack of Brand Personality**: The website failed to convey Studio Carbon's unique design approach and philosophy.
- **Poor User Flow**: Navigation was confusing, making it difficult for potential clients to find relevant information.
- **Outdated Technology**: The site wasn't optimized for modern web standards, resulting in slow load times and poor mobile experience.

"Render Rewind" is a curated collection that delves into the early stages of my creative journey, showcasing a series of 3D renders that capture the essence of my artistic evolution. These pieces, created during the formative years of my career between 2015 and 2019, reflect the experimentation, learning, and growth that have shaped my current style.

## The Journey

My venture into 3D rendering began in late 2015 when I first encountered Blender, an open-source 3D creation suite. At the time, I was a product design student fascinated by the potential of creating entire worlds from scratch. The learning curve was steep, and each render in this collection represents countless hours of tutorials, trial and error, and moments of both frustration and triumph.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding lighting and materials. In the early renders, you'll notice a tendency towards stark, high-contrast lighting and somewhat unrealistic material properties. As the collection progresses, you can see a gradual improvement in the subtlety of light interaction and the authenticity of surface textures.

## From Past to Present

Looking at these early works, it's fascinating to see the seeds of my current style. The experimentation with surreal landscapes in pieces like "Geometric Awakening" has evolved into my current focus on creating immersive, otherworldly environments. The color palettes and lighting techniques I stumbled upon in renders like "Neon Cityscape" have been refined and now form a core part of my visual language.

However, what strikes me most is how these early works reflect a raw, unfiltered creativity. While my technical skills have significantly improved since then, these pieces remind me of the importance of maintaining that spirit of experimentation and willingness to push boundaries.

## Looking Forward

"Render Rewind" isn't just a nostalgic look back; it's a source of inspiration for the future. Revisiting these works has rekindled my enthusiasm for some techniques I had set aside and sparked ideas for how to incorporate them into my current, more technically proficient workflow.

As I continue to grow as a product designer, I carry with me the lessons learned from each of these early renders. They serve as a reminder of how far I've come and inspire me to keep pushing further, always maintaining the sense of wonder and exploration that led me to 3D art in the first place.

This collection is more than just a showcase of old worksâ€”it's a testament to the journey of constant learning and evolution that defines the path of an artist. As I look to the future, I'm excited to see how the seeds planted in these early renders will continue to grow and shape my artistic vision.

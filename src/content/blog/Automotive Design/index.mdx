## Supercharging My Automotive Design Process with AI 

I've always had a passion for sketching and visualizing cars in my free time. Recently, I've been experimenting with AI to take my automotive design hobby to the next level, using a tool called [**Optic**](https://optic.com). The results have been incredible.

### What is Optic?

**Optic** is an AI tool created by designers, for designers. Its aim is to enhance our capabilities and streamline our workflow by intelligently leveraging machine learning.[^1]

<Callout>
  Optic uses a generative AI model trained on a vast dataset of automotive designs. It deeply understands the language and principles of vehicle design.

Optic's intuitive controls allow me to dictate the shape and style I'm going for, without needing complex prompts. 

### My AI-Assisted Design Workflow

My process using Optic:

1. Upload initial concept sketch into Optic
2. Use **Shape Control** to guide the model to follow contours and design elements
3. Add **Inspiration Images** to infuse elements from other designs or art
4. Adjust **Model Settings** to control AI's creative freedom
   - More freedom during ideation
   - Tighten settings for refinement

Throughout the process, Optic generates a variety of design variations and ideas based on my original sketch.

<Callout type="info">
  The key to successful AI-assisted design is finding the right balance between human creativity and AI capabilities. It's about guiding the AI rather than letting it take full control.
</Callout>

### The Result 

Optic provides a wealth of new directions to explore and develop. It deepens and expands my creative vision, allowing me to take my car design hobby to new heights.

<Callout type="warning">
  While AI is a powerful tool, it's important to remember that it's an assistant, not a replacement for human creativity and expertise in design.
</Callout>

> AI-assisted design is an exhilarating way to explore my passion for automotive visualization. The efficiency and creative boost that Optic provides has become an indispensable part of my design process.

I'm excited to continue pushing boundaries by combining my UI/UX design skills with AI to create stunning vehicle concepts in my spare time.
